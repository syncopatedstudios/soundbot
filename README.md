# Soundbot

Aiming to be a some sort of sound related thing....can't focus.

sorting, stitching, sampling, sequencing...

* browse library of sounds, by various criteria
  - related complementary frequencies
  - keys/scales/chords
  - volume/tempo
  - duration
  - intrsument class
    - percussion
    - strings
    - etc
  - %

* assemble soundfonts/drumkits/sample_packs

% = ideally, using essentia with their fancy models, be able to classify
sounds based on subjective concepts of mood
